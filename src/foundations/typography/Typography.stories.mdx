# Typography

---

> Text an integral part of any user interface, so it’s important that all typographic elements are designed
> for legibility and consistency. This section defines the typographic style and usage guidelines.

## Typefaces

Compass uses Metropolis and Open Sans as the primary typefaces. Metropolis is a modern, geometric typeface that is
open-sourced, and openly available. It has been designed for optimal readability at small point sizes while remaining
beautiful at large point sizes.

**Metropolis is used for headings 300-700. See below for more details.**

Open Sans is another modern sans-serif typeface that is incredibly legible and offers an excellent reading experience.
It was developed to have high performance as a web font and is considered to be a font that combines all of the
strongest attributes of the top sans serif fonts. Open Sans is available to be used freely in products or projects.

**Open Sans is used for all body copy and headings 50-200. See below for more details.**

## Type Scale

### Scale Ratio

A type scale has been chosen to ensure that different sizes of text can work together harmoniously. Font sizes have a
scale of 1.125. This means that each size is multiplied or divided by 1.125 from the previous size, starting with the
base size, and then rounded.

## Base Font Size

The base font size for the Mattermost Web App is 14px—also known as the base size '100' in our typographic scale.

### Line Heights

Body copy line heights generally use a multiplier of 1.5 based on the font size, but some adjustmentshave been made
in order for the baselines to fall on the 4px grid.

Heading line heights generally use a multiplier of 1.3 based on the font size, but some adjustments have been made in
order for the baselines to fall on the 4px grid. Smaller headings also use the 1.5 multiplier.

## Headings

### Font Weights

Headings are generally used in the semibold font-weight, but can also be used in regular or light weights in special
cases where the typographic contrast is needed.

### Heading Sizes

The chart below shows all the heading sizes from Heading 100 to Heading 700, where 100 is the base font size as
described above.
